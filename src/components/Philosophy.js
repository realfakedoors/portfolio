I get the feeling I’m more self-sufficient than most, since I’ve never had a mentor or instructor over my shoulder if I can’t figure out why my validations won’t pass or the server won’t start. I love working across the full stack because I like wearing all the hats: from database architecture to building APIs, from designing front-end interfaces to crafting user experiences, I enjoy every facet of web development.`}</p>

      >{`The service industry taught me a lot of important skills: multitasking, attention to detail, conflict resolution, time management. I look forward to applying these skills, growing continuously through this new career while working alongside smart and capable people. At this point, I feel useful enough to contribute to a team, and I've studied enough at this point to be able to pick up new things quickly. If you’ve read this far and you've had a chance to check out my projects, thanks for the consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon!`}</p>
